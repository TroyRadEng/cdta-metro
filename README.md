ðŸš†ðŸš† Imaginary metro system for the Capital Region

What if the New York Capital Region's Capital District Transit Authority (CDTA) had a light passenger system connecting all the area's major cities?  While most would call this a political and financial impossibility in the current moment, some sort of new public transit infrastructure for the region will likely be forced into being by the immense demands of global climate change and dwindling fossil fuel reserves.  This project is an idea thrown into that conceptual space in an effort to promote thinking about a post-carbon future as well as transit as a public good.

The design consists of a .json file that can be loaded into Justin Wright's game [Brand New Subway](http://jpwright.net/projects/subway/). In order to open the map, load up the game in a browser, type one of the Capital District's cities as your starting point (Troy, Albany, Schenectady or Saratoga Springs), then hit "Load" and select the .json file from this repo as the file to be loaded.
